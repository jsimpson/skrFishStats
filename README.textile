h3. What?

skrFishStats is a very simple fishing statistics collection addon. It stores statistics about the types of fish you catch and offers ways to view this data.

Right now, it only has a live display for the current zone/subzone that you are fishing in.

h3. Motivation

Obviously inspired by FishingBuddy. But, I don't really want the overwhelming majority of FishingBuddy's functionality. I really just want an addon that logs my fishing data and gives it to me in a presentable way.

Be warned: This shit is <b>pretty sloppy</b> right now.
