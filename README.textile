h3. What is it?
skrFishStats is a very simple fishing statistics collection addon. It stores statistics about the types of fish you catch and offers ways to display this data.

Right now, it only has a live display for the current zone/subzone that you are fishing in.
    * /skrfishdata
    * /skrfish
    * /skrfs

h3. Motivation
Obviously this was inspired by FishingBuddy. But, I don't really want the overwhelming majority of FishingBuddy's functionality. I really just want an addon that logs my fishing data and gives it to me in a presentable way.

I also borrowed aspects of this mod from a couple of other addons/authors.

h3. To-Do
* Add "location browser" functionality
