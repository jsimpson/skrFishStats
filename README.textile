h3. What is it?

skrFishStats is a very simple fishing statistics collection addon. It stores statistics about the types of fish you catch and offers some very basic ways to view this data.

Right now, it has both a live display for the current zone/subzone that you are fishing in and the ability to browse stats by zone/subzone. The display will be toggled automatically when equipping fishing gear, from actively fishing, or via the command:
    * /skrfs

h3. Motivation

Obviously this was inspired by FishingBuddy. But, I don't really want the overwhelming majority of FishingBuddy's functionality. I really just want an addon that logs my fishing data and gives it to me in a presentable way.

I also borrowed aspects of this mod from a couple of other addons/authors.

h3. Misc

* Discovered that areas along the Southfury river (moving between Azshara/Ashenvale/Durotar) don't trigger the ZONE_CHANGED event
